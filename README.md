# Qt Date Model

This is a little Qt example from the area of Model/View programming
with Qt. 

It provides a simple and hopefully useful way of displaying an overview
of lets say a document collection sorted by their dates. The view can be
organized in a tree view, so that all documents of a year appear under
one top level year item. Underneath the year, all month are listed, and 
within there are the documents with the overview data.

As a bonus, the sums of a column (ie. the revenue) or the amount of 
documents can be added to the month- and year rows.

Maybe it's useful.
